Do not clone the repo and use it directly (if you like the setup); this probably will never
work for you. Instead: - if you are new to this kind of software, explore and learn it
first. If you are familiar with this category, it would be much easier to read it, pick &
use whatever you like, instead of replication.

Currently I've purged the legacy configuration from this repo, i.e. if you want
to check the KDE, Xfce, exwm, or whatever configuration you will have to go
through commit history (I wouldn't give it this much effort tho, it was shitty
configuration).

I will try to focus in documenting only the current setup.


* TODO Emacs

I spend ~95% of my time while doing computing inside Emacs, this probably is the
most important part of this configuration system, The following contains my
favorite Emacs keybindings, some of them are defined by default and other are
only in my configuration.
* TODO Dynamic Window Manager
* TODO lf file manager
* TODO MPV
* TODO MVI
* TODO Zathura
