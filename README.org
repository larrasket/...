[2025-12-31 Wed 03:22] Hi! In 2025, I started using MacOS. I no longer use DWM, Vim, or many other software that's well-configured here. I'm keeping this here, however, for two reasons: 1. I still use Emacs, sometimes it's useful to share some Elisp code from here. 2. A lot of nostaliga here! I even didn't delete the screenshots, although they do exist in version control history, I'm really grateful to everything I learnt in my journey with FOSS, Linux, BSD, and everything.

------

Personal dot files, configurations gathered from/for BSDs and GNU/Linux based
systems. It also contains a lot of personal-related stuff, like my music
library.

I do not think anyone would be interested in using those files other than me,
but they are available here anyway. Maybe you would be interested in my Emacs
configuration instead, it's available too in this repo. Note that I use my own
fork of Doom Emacs (an Emacs framework), it's available on [[https://git.sr.ht/~lr0/.emacs.d][~lr0/.emacs.d]]. There
are some screenshots too in this repository.
