                  loneliness and self-rated health (SRH), and whether there were
                  race differences between non-Hispanic Black and White adults
                  in these associations.1,407 participants were drawn Social
                  Relations Study, a regional study of social relations across
                  the lifespan with three waves of data collection in 1992,
                  2005, and 2015 (Wave 1, W1: Mage = 50.28, 28\\% Black, 59\\%
                  female). Cross-lagged structural equation models examined the
                  association between loneliness and SRH over three waves. We
                  adjusted for baseline age, gender, social network size, and
                  depressive symptoms.There were no race differences in
                  loneliness at any wave. Loneliness W1 was associated with
                  Loneliness W2; Loneliness W2 was associated with Loneliness
                  W3. We had similar findings for associations among SRH.
                  However, only one of the cross-lagged paths was significant.
                  Worse SRH W2 was associated with more Loneliness W3. The only
                  path that varied across race was in the association between
                  SRH W2 and Loneliness W3, and this path was significant only
                  in Whites.Findings indicate that loneliness at later midlife
                  may be detrimental to later life health, particularly for
                  Whites. As a valid indicator of health, SRH can be used in the
                  body of research on health correlates of loneliness as adults
                  age. Use of the current sample of Black and White adults
                  provides nuanced understanding in the ways in which racially
                  diverse adults experience loneliness and should be useful in
                  refining and developing culturally competent interventions for
                  older adults.}",

                  presented as an agenda for a genuine structuralist
                  neuroscience of consciousness that seeks to understand
                  specific phenomenal experiences as strictly relational
                  affairs. The paper covers a broad range of topics. It starts
                  from considerations about neural change detection and
                  relational coding that motivate a solution of the Newman
                  problem of the brain in terms of spatiotemporal relations.
                  Next, phenomenal quality spaces and their Q-structures are
                  discussed. Neurophenomenal structuralism proclaims a
                  homomorphic mapping of the structures of self-organized neural
                  maps in the brain onto Q-structures, and it will be
                  demonstrated how this leads to a new and special version of
                  structural representationalism about phenomenal content. A
                  methodological implication of neurophenomenal structuralism is
                  that it proposes measurement procedures that focus on the
                  relationships between different stimuli (as, for instance,
                  similarity ratings or representational geometry methods).
                  Finally, it will be shown that neurophenomenal structuralism
                  also has strong philosophical implications, as it leads to
                  holism about phenomenal experiences and serves to reject
                  inverted qualia scenarios.}",

                  of psychology and the law. The purpose of this book is to
                  examine topics in the field, using the powerful,
                  multidisciplinary, conceptually integrated approach that the
                  natural sciences have embraced for decades with great success.
                  Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is the
                  meta-theoretical framework that unifies the field of biology.
                  It unites research with understanding of the development,
                  control, and organization of behavior. The study of humans,
                  which includes all of the social sciences, is part of the
                  field of biology. Darwin's theory provides a powerful
                  meta-theoretical framework that can unify and energize
                  forensic psychology, just as it has the biological sciences.
                  Evolutionary processes undoubtedly shaped physiological
                  characteristics to help solve problems of survival and
                  reproduction. The lungs, for example, with their vast surface
                  area and moist membranes, are marvellous adaptations for
                  extracting oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Natural
                  selection is the only known process capable of shaping complex
                  functional mechanisms. Just as it shaped physiological
                  adaptations with specific problem-solving functions, it also
                  shaped our thoughts and emotions to guide behaviors toward
                  solving recurrent problems of survival and reproduction. With
                  this logic, we can use knowledge of ancestral problems to
                  guide our understanding of how the mind works. Evolutionary
                  Forensic Psychology is a step toward a unified and complete
                  understanding of psychology and the law. It recognizes that
                  crimes such as murder, nonlethal violence, rape, and theft are
                  manifestations of evolutionarily recurrent selection when they
                  gave individuals an advantage in competition for resources.
                  Each of the chapters that comprise this volume has been
                  selected to provide a unified examination of research
                  contributions and future directions of evolutionary forensic

  abstract        = {Stemming is a computational process for reducing words to
                  their roots (or stems). It can be classified as a
                  recall-enhancing or precision-enhancing component.Existing
                  Arabic stemmers suffer from high stemming error-rates. Arabic
                  stemmers blindly stem all the words and perform poorly
                  especially with compound words, nouns and foreign Arabized
                  words.The Educated Text Stemmer (ETS) is presented in this
                  paper. ETS is a dictionary free, simple, and highly effective
                  Arabic stemming algorithm that can reduce stemming errors in
                  addition to decreasing computational time and data storage.The
                  novelty of the work arises from the use of neglected Arabic
                  stop-words. These stop-words can be highly important and can
                  provide a significant improvement to processing Arabic
                  documents.The ETS stemmer is evaluated by comparison with
                  output from human generated stemming and the stemming weight
                  technique.},
