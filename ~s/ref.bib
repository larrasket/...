                  had long been of importance to Western philosophers and
                  theologians. Nonetheless, before the eighteenth century
                  intelligence, as a description of overall mental capacity, had
                  little provenance on either side of the Atlantic.
                  Intelligence, as a separate area of research, began to attract
                  attention as growing curiosity about the nature of human
                  differences meshed with the turn to scientific methods as
                  privileged forms of explanation. This article explores that
                  history and highlights how the Intelligent Quotient version of
                  intelligence has come to dominate Western understandings of
                  the concept.}

  abstract        = {Abstract After several decades of heavy research activity
                  on English stemmers, Arabic morphological analysis techniques
                  have become a popular area of research. The Arabic language is
                  one of the Semitic languages; it exhibits a very systematic
                  but complex morphological structure based on root-pattern
                  schemes. As a consequence, survey of such techniques proves to
                  be more necessary. The aim of this paper is to summarize and
                  organize the information available in the literature in an
                  attempt to motivate researchers to look into these techniques
                  and try to develop more advanced ones. This paper introduces,
                  classifies, and surveys Arabic morphological analysis
                  techniques. Furthermore, conclusions, open areas, and future
                  directions are provided at the end.},

  abstract        = { In the recent past, the world has been witnessing a steady
                  increase in the area of natural language processing owing to
                  the spread of the internet. However, attempts and efforts
                  devoted for Arabic language are still limited. By
                  morphological and semantic properties, Arabic is considered a
                  difficult language in the field of automatic processing. From
                  that perspective, many different approaches were attempted to
                  deal with the morphological variation and the agglutination
                  phenomenon while stemming Arabic texts. Formally, stemming and
                  light-stemming are used to remove irrelevant morphological
                  variations from a given word, and extract its original stem or
                  root. This research introduces a complete new rules-based
                  algorithm. This involves precise removal of affixes based on
                  context-sensitive morphological rules and then deduces the
                  root according to a predefined set of rules. Finally, results
                  show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher
                  than the two well-known Arabic stemmers. }

  abstract        = "Arabic has a very rich and complex morphology. Its
                  appropriate morphological processing is very important for
                  Information Retrieval (IR). In this paper, we propose a new
                  stemming technique that tries to determine the stem of a word
                  representing the semantic core of this word according to
                  Arabic morphology. This method is compared to a commonly used
                  light stemming technique which truncates a word by simple
                  rules. Our tests on TREC collections show that the new
                  stemming technique is more effective than the light stemming.",
