  abstract        = { This paper looks at a number of different elements that
                  make up the experience of torture by lesbians in the
                  contemporary world. I draw together elements of popular
                  culture, along with testimonies by lesbians, concerning
                  torture in diverse countries, as well as citing some
                  historical sources. I examine the justifications and excuses
                  given for torture, including the view that rape is a normal
                  part of heterosexual activity. I argue that domination is
                  exemplified in the punishment of lesbians as outsiders in
                  patriarchal culture, in particular when groups and nations go
                  to war.I also look at the way in which arguments for the
                  legalization of torture share similarities with arguments in
                  favor of prostitution, pornography, and consensual BDSM. I
                  challenge the defenders of these acts and argue that such
                  defense is a case of moral neglect. I conclude with the
                  contention that the freedom of lesbians from torture and
                  violence may be an indicator of the social health of a
                  society.},

                  had long been of importance to Western philosophers and
                  theologians. Nonetheless, before the eighteenth century
                  intelligence, as a description of overall mental capacity, had
                  little provenance on either side of the Atlantic.
                  Intelligence, as a separate area of research, began to attract
                  attention as growing curiosity about the nature of human
                  differences meshed with the turn to scientific methods as
                  privileged forms of explanation. This article explores that
                  history and highlights how the Intelligent Quotient version of
                  intelligence has come to dominate Western understandings of
                  the concept.}

                  on English stemmers, Arabic morphological analysis techniques
                  have become a popular area of research. The Arabic language is
                  one of the Semitic languages; it exhibits a very systematic
                  but complex morphological structure based on root-pattern
                  schemes. As a consequence, survey of such techniques proves to
                  be more necessary. The aim of this paper is to summarize and
                  organize the information available in the literature in an
                  attempt to motivate researchers to look into these techniques
                  and try to develop more advanced ones. This paper introduces,
                  classifies, and surveys Arabic morphological analysis
                  techniques. Furthermore, conclusions, open areas, and future
                  directions are provided at the end.},

                  However, there are situations in which disgust at core
                  elicitors (e.g., feces) must be modulated in the service of
                  other goals (e.g., caring for a close kin). In Study 1,
                  mothers of infants completed a self-report questionnaire about
                  their reactions to changing their baby's feces-soiled diaper
                  compared with the diaper of someone else's baby. In Study 2,
                  mothers of infants were presented with a series of trials in
                  which they smelled concealed samples of their own baby's
                  feces-soiled diaper and those of someone else's baby. In
                  addition, labels were used to identify the source of the
                  sample (correctly labeled, mislabeled, or no label). Both
                  studies provide evidence suggesting that mothers regard their
                  own baby's fecal smell as less disgusting than that from
                  someone else's baby. Furthermore, labeling had relatively
                  little influence on this effect, and the effect persisted when
                  social desirability was controlled.}

                  increase in the area of natural language processing owing to
                  the spread of the internet. However, attempts and efforts
                  devoted for Arabic language are still limited. By
                  morphological and semantic properties, Arabic is considered a
                  difficult language in the field of automatic processing. From
                  that perspective, many different approaches were attempted to
                  deal with the morphological variation and the agglutination
                  phenomenon while stemming Arabic texts. Formally, stemming and
                  light-stemming are used to remove irrelevant morphological
                  variations from a given word, and extract its original stem or
                  root. This research introduces a complete new rules-based
                  algorithm. This involves precise removal of affixes based on
                  context-sensitive morphological rules and then deduces the
                  root according to a predefined set of rules. Finally, results
                  show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher
                  than the two well-known Arabic stemmers. }

  abstract        = {The economic sanctions imposed on Iraq from 1990 to 2003
                  were the most comprehensive and devastating of any established
                  in the name of international governance. The sanctions,
                  coupled with the bombing campaign of 1991, brought about the
                  near collapse of Iraq’s infrastructure and profoundly
                  compromised basic conditions necessary to sustain life. In a
                  sharp indictment of U.S. policy, Joy Gordon examines the key
                  role the nation played in shaping the sanctions, whose harsh
                  strictures resulted in part from U.S. definitions of “dual
                  use" and “weapons of mass destruction," and claims that
                  everything from water pipes to laundry detergent to child
                  vaccines could produce weapons. Drawing on internal UN
                  documents, confidential minutes of closed meetings, and
                  interviews with foreign diplomats and U.S. officials, Gordon
                  details how the United States not only prevented critical
                  humanitarian goods from entering Iraq but also undermined
                  attempts at reform; unilaterally overrode the UN weapons
                  inspectors; and manipulated votes in the Security Council. In
                  every political, legal, and bureaucratic domain, the
                  deliberate policies of the United States ensured the
                  continuation of Iraq’s catastrophic condition. Provocative and
                  sure to stir debate, this book lays bare the damage that can
                  be done by unchecked power in our institutions of
                  international governance.},

                  representing the semantic core of this word according to
                  Arabic morphology. This method is compared to a commonly used
                  light stemming technique which truncates a word by simple
                  rules. Our tests on TREC collections show that the new
                  stemming technique is more effective than the light stemming.",

                  origins and the development of rape and sexual aggression
                  against women. For the most part, the first three generations
                  of research and theorizing provided an inherently static view
                  of the propensity among males to commit a sexual aggression,
                  providing little information about the developmental processes
                  involved in the origins and course of sexually aggressive
                  behavior. This article provides a review of contemporary
                  explanations of sexual aggression against women and an
                  examination of the underlying developmental issues that these
                  models imply. Given the emergence of longitudinal research on
                  sexual aggression, these issues are then contrasted and
                  compared with the relatively nascent body of knowledge about
                  the origins and the development of sexual aggression over the
                  life course. More specifically, in recent years a fourth
                  generation of research and theorizing concerned by the
                  developmental and life course factors conducive to rape and
                  sexual aggression has emerged. This fourth generation proposes
                  a more dynamic etiological framework to understand the origins
                  and the development of sexually aggressive behaviors that is
                  directed by men toward women. Emerging research from this
                  generation highlight unresolved issues about, among other
                  things, the understanding of the continuity and discontinuity
                  of rape and sexual aggression over time as well as the
                  developmental pathways leading to rape and sexual aggression.}

                  review of literature on pornography use and sexual consent
                  published between January 2000 and December 2017. The review
                  found that there exists little research explicitly addressing
                  consent. There exists an extensive literature on the
                  relationship between the consumption of pornography and sexual
                  aggression/violence; however, this work fails to distinguish
                  between consensual (kink, spanking, BDSM) and nonconsensual
                  acts (sexual harassment and rape). Our thematic analysis found
                  that there is no agreement in the literature reviewed as to
                  whether consumption of pornography is correlated with better
                  or worse understandings or practices of sexual consent. The
                  majority of articles that identified correlations between
                  aspects of sexual health and pornography consumption
                  incorrectly assigned causality to pornography consumption. }

                  depend on prostitution for survival. The accumulated body of
                  research on the topic suggests particular family experiences
                  and adolescent behaviors are characteristic of prostitutes.
                  Although a link between childhood sexual victimization and
                  prostitution has been suggested in the literature, some
                  previous findings are contradictory. Forty-five adolescent
                  prostitutes and 37 adolescents who were not prostitutes were
                  interviewed regarding their experiences related to childhood
                  physical and sexual abuse, leaving home, family functioning,
                  parental alcohol use, marital violence, adolescent alcohol and
                  drug use, and level of self-esteem. Although the results of
                  this study replicated previous findings about background
                  experiences of prostitutes, when an appropriate comparison
                  group was considered, these same factors failed to
                  discriminate between prostitute and nonprostitute youth. This
                  suggests that these factors may not be critical for entry into
                  prostitution. }

  abstract        = { OBJECTIVES: This study examined the extent to which being
                  abused and/or neglected in childhood increases a person's risk
                  for promiscuity, prostitution, and teenage pregnancy. METHODS:
                  A prospective cohorts design was used to match, on the basis
                  of age, race, sex, and social class, cases of abused and/or
                  neglected children from 1967 to 1971 with nonabused and
                  nonneglected children; subjects were followed into young
                  adulthood. From 1989 to 1995 1196 subjects (676 abused and/or
                  neglected and 520 control subjects were located and
                  interviewed. RESULTS: Early childhood abuse and/or neglect was
                  a significant predictor of prostitution for females (odds
                  ratio [OR] = 2.96). For females, sexual abuse (OR = 2.54) and
                  neglect (OR = 2.58) were associated with prostitution, whereas
                  physical abuse was only marginally associated. Childhood abuse
                  and neglect were not associated with increased risk for
                  promiscuity or teenage pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings
                  strongly support a relationship between childhood
                  victimization and subsequent prostitution. The presumed causal
                  sequence between childhood victimization and teenage pregnancy
                  may need to be reevaluated. }
