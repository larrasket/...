Do not clone the repo and use it directly (if you like the setup); this probably will never
work for you. Instead: - if you are new to this kind of software, explore and learn it
first. If you are familiar with this category, it would be much easier to read it, pick &
use whatever you like, instead of replication.


* Tags/Releases

This repo used to be too missy, I tried multiple times to organize it in some manners, but
as you can notice, in vain. The following contains some helpful description of what the
tags/releases supposed to mean (at least what I can recall).

+ [[https://github.com/salehmu/dots/releases/tag/goodbyeAcario][goodbyeAcario]]; White dwm, white emacs with acario-light theme.
+ [[https://github.com/salehmu/dots/releases/tag/module!][module!]]; same as preceding, but with doom emacs config organized as modules.
+ [[https://github.com/salehmu/dots/releases/tag/StableGrayEmacs30][StableGrayEmacs30]]; Stalbe Emacs configuration, gray with grady dwm.
+ [[https://github.com/salehmu/dots/releases/tag/2023.03.1][2023.03.1]]; just black
