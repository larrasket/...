Personal dot files, configurations gathered from/for BSDs and GNU/Linux based
systems. It also contains a lot of personal-related stuff, like my music
library.

I do not think anyone would be interested in using those files other than me,
but they are available here anyway. Maybe you would be interested in my Emacs
configuration instead, it&rsquo;s available too in this repo. Note that I use my own
fork of Doom Emacs (an Emacs framework), it&rsquo;s available on [~lr0/.emacs.d](https://git.sr.ht/~lr0/.emacs.d). There
are some screenshots too in this repository.
